To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation. We demonstrate d3ploy’s capability to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet various types of user-defined power demands: constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal.},

New reactor designs, such as the Ultra Safe Nuclear Cor-poration (USNC) Micro Modular Reactor (MMR)TM, will require High Assay Low EnrichedUranium (HALEU) fuel enriched between 5-20\%.  To meet HALEU fuel requirements, theU.S. Department of Energy is considering recovery and downblending of High Enriched Ura-nium (HEU) fuel and enriching natural uranium to the required levels [1], with each of thesemethods containing their own limitations.  Recovery and downblending of HEU fuel is lim-ited by the existing physical supply of HEU as well as downblending capacity.  Enrichment ofnatural uranium is limited by centrifuge capacity, in terms of Separative Work Unit (SWU).This work aims to quantify the resource requirements of the current U.S. reactor fleetand of the transition to different reactors that require HALEU fuel.  Fuel cycle simulationsare completed usingCyclus, an agent-based fuel cycle simulator [2].  Transition scenariosconsidered include use of the USNC MMRTMand the X-energy Xe-100TMreactor, which bothrequire HALEU fuel.  Resource requirements of interest include enriched fuel requirementsat each enrichment level, HEU required to meet HALEU demand, and natural uranium andSWU required to meet HALEU demand. These metrics will inform the material requirementsand  provide  insight  into  the  best  method  to  meet  fuel  requirements  for  these  transitionscenarios},

This report quantitatively explores how these closures would undermine economic and decarbonization goals in the state of Illinois, such as an aggressive target to achieve a zero carbon electric grid by 2030.
Previous energy systems research has shown that such clean energy goals cannot be reached if nuclear plants prematurely retire [2, 3, 4]. In particular, the February 2021 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine consensus report, “Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System,” determined unequivocally that US decarbonization will require keeping existing nuclear plants open [2]. Consistent with that liter- ature, our simulations indicate that decarbonization in Illinois will require not only maintenance but expansion of nuclear energy capacity.},

	abstract = {The ability to characterize used nuclear fuel (UNF) is important for nuclear nonproliferation safeguards, criticality safety, and fuel storage. Multiple efforts have been made to estimate the burnup (BU), initial enrichment (IE), and cooling time (CT) based on multivariate models of isotopic concentrations and radiation signatures of the fuel. This work provides a comparison of multivariate modeling techniques and extends previous work by quantifying the uncertainty of the best model to predict each characteristic. Model inputs used are simulated gamma and neutron emissions from UNF of varying BU, IE, and CT. Modeling techniques explored include Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS). Multiple PCR and PLS models were built based on different variable selection methods, such as cross validation and Akaike Information Criteria. The OLS model predictions have a root mean square percent error (RMSPE) of less than 10\%, but the models are very unstable. The PCR models exhibit a trade-off between accurate and stable predictions. The best performing PCR and PLS models have similar predictions errors, but the PLS models are favored due to their stability. The best model for each characteristic is a single output PLS model based on cross validation. The uncertainty of each of these models, based on their prediction variance and biases, is 0.220 GWd/MTU, 0.051\% U-235, and 0.694 years for the BU, IE, and CT models, respectively. By building a 95\% prediction interval based on the corresponding uncertainty of each characteristic, 1.97\% of the BU predictions, 23.03\% of the IE predictions, and 100\% of the CT predictions lack 95\% confidence that they are within the prescribed accuracy requirement for the characteristic.},

	abstract = {Transitioning to High Assay Low Enriched Uranium-fueled reactors will alter the material requirements of the current nuclear fuel cycle, in terms of the mass of enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity. This work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios using Cyclus to compare how the type of the advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the material requirements of the transition to High Assay Low Enriched Uranium-fueled reactors. Fuel cycle scenarios considered include the current fleet of Light Water Reactors in the U.S. as well as a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor or the X-energy Xe-100 reactor from the current fleet of U.S. Light Water Reactors. This work explored parameters of interest including the number of advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition. Fueling Xe-100 reactors requires less enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity than fueling Light Water Reactors before the transition.},

Therefore, multiple methods have been developed to account for depletion within fuel cycle simulations. This work adds to that list of methods by introducing an open-source coupling between Cyclus and OpenMC to perform fuel depletion during a fuel cycle simulation, called OpenMCyclus. This work explains the methodology of OpenMCyclus and presents a benchmark comparison between the performance of OpenMCyclus and another Cyclus archetype that uses recipes to define spent fuel compositions. The development of this coupling expands the functionalities possible through Cyclus by providing real-time fuel depletion that is reactor agnostic and open source.},
